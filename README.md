# Reward distance
The idea of these experiments is to compare different EPIC-like
reward function distances and see how well they correlate with each other,
as well as with regret from rolling out the policy.

## Intended audience
This repo is meant for my co-authors.

## Repo structure
All the source code is located in the `/src` directory. The files that execute
the individual experiments is located in the `/src/experiments` subdirectory,
with `/src/__main__.py` being a convenient way to execute them from the command line.

## Help
If you have any questions, please get in touch with me. If something in this
repo looks stupid, that's probably because it is.
